In this project we will work on converting .py file to .exe file, now if we
want to share any python file to our friend we can share it in .exe file 
for which we need a python file in our system otherwise it will not run.

The process is like every friend doesn't need to setup python installation in thier 
system they can use .exe file and make use of it.

There are two methods with which we can convert .exe First is the direct method
and second is by the adding the configuration with logo or multiple file attached.

Now open the command prompt and install pyinstaller
Syntax - pip install pyinstaller
