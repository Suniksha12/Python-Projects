In this project we will work on converting .py file to .exe file, now if we
want to share any python file to our friend we can share it in .exe file 
for which we need a python file in our system otherwise it will not run.

The process is like every friend doesn't need to setup python installation in thier 
system they can use .exe file and make use of it.

There are two methods with which we can convert .exe First is the direct method
and second is by the adding the configuration with logo or multiple file attached.

Now open the command prompt and install pyinstaller
Syntax - pip install pyinstaller

Now for Converting the file directly just open the command prompt in the same file, 
also take any code for which has an extend=sion of .py now in the command prompt 
write 

Syntax : pyinstaller digital.py

Just aftering writing that after some time your file will be converted by multiple folders will be created 
for which you have to go to dist folder then click on the another folder 
and then you will find your .exe file but there are multiple other files created 
also when you click your .exe file you will see that automatically it is running without any
command.

Now if we want only single file of that .py file then open the command prompt 
write the command 

Syntax - pyinstaller --onefile filename.py

then under your dist folder you will get your .exe file 
and you can share it with your friends.
