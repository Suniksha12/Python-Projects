now for the second method craete a fresh folder and there you copy your
.py code file insdie that you open command prompt and write the command
 
Syntax: pip install auto-py-to-exe 

This is the module name and it will get installed in your system.

After successfull installation write the command again 

Syntax: auto-py-to-exe (Enter)

then a windown will open and which will aksk you certain things like 
path file , choose one file cause we have only one file no such directory,
choose window based(hide the console) cause the python file already has graphichs
if no such graphics and the file is runnnig under the command prompt then choose
console based.
Add your icon or any other additional features and then simply click on 
convert button whihc will convert your file.

Again in the same folder you wil have to have your one file.
