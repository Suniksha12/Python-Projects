 In this project we will understand that whatever pdf we are provided with many pages and if we want every page to be converted into a pdf
then we can do using python.

In this project we need a module named pikepdf 

for this keep the pdf on the same directory where you save your python coding file 

Also open the command prompt right click on it and then write the following lines:
pip install pikepdf
