So after the static websites we have dynamic websites:-

so Dynamic websites offer unique content to visitors each time thery view the site.

This display changes depending on a number of factors like viewers demographics, time of day,
location, language settings and so on.

Dynamic websites are those whose content or data and pages changes on regular basis.

for example we have made a ecommerce products then lets suppose we have 4 products diaplayed
now the 4 products are displayed in a single row now the single row will be fixed 
but the inside content will be changed.

According to the user changing the data is dynamic.

whenever we make Dynamic website we have website which is shown or displayed to the user and the 
next we have control panel which is handles by the client.

Control panel is always given to the client and he/she can only make changes.

with the help of control panel you can make user understand that that can update their data
without any use of coding.

wordpress is used for making complete dynamic website.

For dynamic webiste we have PHP , Mysql , larvel , wordpress and we can connect to mysql database or 
server. No its not necesaary to use the Php as backedn language you can also use Node.js or Java or .Net or 
or Python with Django any one can be used as a backend language to generate backend.
