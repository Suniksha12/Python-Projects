So after the static websites we have dynamic websites:-

so Dynamic websites offer unique content to visitors each time thery view the site.

This display changes depending on a number of factors like viewers demographics, time of day,
location, language settings and so on.

Dynamic websites are those whose content or data and pages changes on regular basis.

for example we have made a ecommerce products then lets suppose we have 4 products diaplayed
now the 4 products are displayed in a single row now the single row will be fixed 
but the inside content will be changed.

According to the user changing the data is dynamic.
