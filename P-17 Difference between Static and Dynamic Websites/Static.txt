There are peoples who have confusion like what is static and dynamic websites like we are 
building something in wordpress with html css , or php or laravel then is that static or dynamic 

Lets make it clear that  static websites are those whose content and images do not 
change throughout the process.

static websites does not reuiqre any kind of database to store any kind of information
of the user or of the website.

In static websites the dependency depends on the developer.

With the help of HTML and CSS you build a fixed content.

the loading and browsing of static sites are faster than dynamic websites since 
the static websites have nothing to do with the server and therefore, directly load 
on the client's server.
