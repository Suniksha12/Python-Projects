In this project we are going to build a Screen recorder for our project for which 
we require certian modules.

Like open the command prompot and write the few lines of code to install.
Synatx : pip install opencv-python
         pip install pywin32
         pip install numpy
         pip install pyautogui 

Now this openCv is used to take the screen shots in MILLISECONDS and 
by merging them all it give videos as output.
