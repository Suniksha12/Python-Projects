In this Project we will work on how we can work with 2 diffenrnt files of python in one system.

Also we will se Virtual envirnonment and requiremnets.txt.

Virtual envirnonment suppose we have a python then it makes a clone of it.

so requirements.txt is the txt files which stores all the version of the python file.
