In this project we will see how we can create a dice roll stimulation like evryone in our childhood we have dice roll for offline games right ??
then you have also seen dice roll in online games also , so we will use python for building this.

Now this can be built using python GUI a desktop application for which we reuiqre Tkinter module and along with this
we require a pillow module.

For this we need to install the modules so open command prompt in the same directory where you will save your .py file and just write 
the following lines Syntax: pip install pillow , for tkinter its preinstalled with python library so no need to install again.
