In this project we will see  how we can extract images from a pdf in a pdf
we have text as well as images so when you select the text you can only text and cannot select
images for which we will built a python code.

for this we require a module called pikepdf and for this open the command prompt
in the same directory where you have saved your .py file and then write the following
command : pip install pikepdf

Also keep the pdf in the smae directory where you have saved your .py file.
