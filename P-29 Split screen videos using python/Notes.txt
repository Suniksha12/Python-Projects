In this project we will be creating split screen video using python.

Suppose we have a video and what if we merge 4 videos in a single video then it sounds interesting right 
we can do it in python as well.

With this we require a module name moviepy

Open your command prompt and write the following command:
Syntax : pip install moviepy

Take four videos in the same directory where you have saved your python file.
