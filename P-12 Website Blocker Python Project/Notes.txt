In this Project we are going to built a website Blocker, like in any system how we can block certain websites in certain time period.

Before doing it in python we can also do manually.

for doing manually then we have some host file in our system we need to do some changes there and then 
we can block the website.

If we are working will administrative file then whichever software we are using should get an administrative permission,
without that it wont work.

Step 1 : open notepad and then click run with administrator
step 2 : click on file and select open , traverse to C drive 
Step 3 : traverse to  widows folder open it , the system 32 file open it , open driver file, 
         then open etc file.
Now no such file will be seen cause we have opened a text document file ,
On the Right hand side of the file name select all files and you will get to see many files.

Step 5 : Then search for Host file and open it. Inside this below we can see localhost file with that address  we can block any website.
Step 6 : In the same File write the id of your HostFile and thenwrite the website link remove the http:// then try to open it 
         you will find that your website has been blocked and its blocked only for your system.

With this you can block the website.
