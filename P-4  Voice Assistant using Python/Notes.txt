How to make a Voice Assitant in Python

In the .py file you need to install some modules.

Firstly we will give command in voice and that should be converted in text format.
For this we will need a speech recognizer, if we want to return out something then  text-to-speech module is used 
For this module we can use Syntax - import pyttsx3
For command line use this - pip install pyttsx3 (this is offline and supports multiple voices best for general offline use.)
for  speech recognizer we use command line and type - pip install SpeechRecognition
if this does'nt work try upgrading your pip python -m pip install --upgrade pip
and then try with - python -m pip install SpeechRecognition
Also i have imported PyJokes so  install that in your command prompt as well with the line - pip install pyjokes

Additional Modules(optional) - web browser , pyjokes, mail(SMTP), timening(date and time module)

Important modules - speech recognizer and Pyttsx (text to speech converter.)
