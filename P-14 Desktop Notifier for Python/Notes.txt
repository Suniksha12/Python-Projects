In this project we will get notification for our system using python.

There can be types of notification as like it can be online and offline , 
so basically online notifications when we use the internet  and offline notification
are those which diplays the text that we want.

so the modules that needs to be installed are, first open the command prompt 
from the same directory where you have saved your python program file 

syntax used is - pip install plyer

, we also need time module but it is already built-in in python.
