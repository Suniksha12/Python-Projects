In this project we will see suppose we have a pdf with us then how we can convert that pdf into
image format for every page that is present in pdf will be converted to image.

for this we require a module called pdf2image for which open your command prompt in the same directory 
where you have saved your .py file or going to save it and write the follwing command.
Syntax: pip install pdf2image

We also need an extra module to be downloaded and added for which we require to search pdf2image in our chrome
browser and for which we go to the link provided : https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/

then scroll down the page see for poppler installtaion check according to your system.

Since i have windows so i will go to the first blue link provided and then it will open up an github page 
for which you can see that some realease versions are available out of which just download the realease
zip file and save the file in the same directory where you have saved you .py file. Extract that file
and keep it in the directory see the folder should be named a poppler.
