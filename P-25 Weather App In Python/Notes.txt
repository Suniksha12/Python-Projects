In this Project we are going to build a weather App using python in GUI.

we will be working with Tkinter install it using pip install

Open your command prompt and write the follwoing command like 
 pip install tkintertable

 Now how to get api from the server , for this we need api from a App

 like open your chrome browser and search for openWeather.api

 and then sign it go below and search for  current & forecast weather data collection in thiw you will find many API docs
 but instead of that just click API docs and then on the right hand side you will find that
 you can see some built in geocoding under whihch you have some data according to whihc you want to fetch like
 built-in API request by city name or city Id or ZIP code in our code i jave used City name
 then copy the line.

In order to use Api in python we need a module name request
