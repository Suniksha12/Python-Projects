In this Project we will see how we can merge two or more files and make it into one file 
Now we have two files in it like in one frame we have two - three video frames and second we can do it
aftre the first video is completed the second video starts playing after second video is over , third starts
playing and so on...

For this we require module called moviepy for which just open your command prompt and then write the follwing command
Synatx : pip install moviepy

keep the two videos inthe same directory where you have saved your python code.
